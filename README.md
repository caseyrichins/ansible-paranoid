#The ansible paranoid configuration repository.
## Welcome
I welcome you to this repository and encourage you to contribute in any way you are able. The purpose of this repository is to provided playbooks aimed at security and securing systems using standard and best practices. The playbooks should adhere to least privilege principles and should lean toward the paranoid spectrum without making the system unusable.


## <a name="requests"></a> Questions, Bugs, Features

### <a name="question"></a> Got a Question or Problem?

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports
and feature requests. You've got much better chances of getting your question answered by sending an email to the repository owner.

To save your and our time, we will systematically close all issues that are requests for general
support and redirect people to the section you are reading right now.

### <a name="issue"></a> Found an Issue or Bug?

If you find a bug in the code, you can help us by submitting an issue to our
[GitHub Repository][github]. Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix. Playbooks are written against the latest stable version of Ansible which is currently the 2.4x release.

**Please see the [Submission Guidelines](#submit) below.**

### <a name="feature"></a> Missing a Feature?

You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our [GitHub Repository][github-issues].

If you would like to implement a new feature then consider what kind of change it is:

* **Major Changes** that you wish to contribute to the project should be discussed first in an
  [GitHub issue][github-issues] that clearly outlines the changes and benefits of the feature.
* **Small Changes** can directly be crafted and submitted to the [GitHub Repository][github]
  as a Pull Request. See the section about [Pull Request Submission Guidelines](#submit-pr), and
  for detailed information the [core development documentation][developers].

### <a name="docs"></a> Want a Doc Fix?

Should you have a suggestion for the documentation, you can open an issue and outline the problem
or improvement you have - however, creating the doc fix yourself is much better!

If you want to help improve the docs, it's a good idea to let others know what you're working on to
minimize duplication of effort. Create a new issue (or comment on a related existing one) to let
others know what you're working on.

If you're making a small change (typo, phrasing) don't worry about filing an issue first. Use the
friendly blue "Improve this doc" button at the top right of the doc page to fork the repository
in-place and make a quick change on the fly. The commit message is preformatted to the right type
and scope, so you only have to add the description.

For large fixes, please build and test the documentation before submitting the PR to be sure you
haven't accidentally introduced any layout or formatting issues. You should also make sure that your
commit message follows the **[Commit Message Guidelines][developers.commits]**.

## <a name="submit"></a> Issue Submission Guidelines
Before you submit your issue search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue. Help us to maximize
the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new features, by not reporting duplicate issues.

The "[new issue][github-new-issue]" form contains a number of prompts that you should fill out to
make it easier to understand and categorize the issue.
