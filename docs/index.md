# Purpose of project

The purpose or reason this repoistory exists is to provide a central
location for ansible playbooks. The purpose of the playbooks
themselves play a larger part in the overall goal of this project
which is to create a configuration mangement process for small server sites while
adhering to strict security policies and best practices. 

The need for this repository came when there arose a need to provide a
centeral playbook organization strucutre for mutiple clients each being
housed in their own git repo without sharing configurations between the
different clients. After learning about git submodules I decided to
rethink and redesign my entire work flow to allow me to centrally store
all the configuration files, playbooks and templates in a centeral
fashion while still allowing me to make use of those playbooks with each
client without having have a massively complex strcture. 

Along with allowing me to share playbooks with clients I also had the
eiphany to publish a public copy to allow colaboration with others who are
having to address the same issue as myself, hence your being able find
this project on github.
